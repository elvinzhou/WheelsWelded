The airplane is a single engine, normally aspirated, low wing configuration with tricycle landing gear. 
The airframe is aluminum alloy construction except for steel components comprising: engine mount, 
landing gear, landing gear mounts, elevator control horns and other miscellaneous items. The tips of the wings and tail surfaces as well as cowling, landing gear fairings, empennage fairings and cabin top are fabricated from fiberglass. The constant cord wing platform chosen for the RV-10 offers the ultimate in construction ease, stability and lifting ability. The possible drag and aesthetic penalties for the rectangular wing are negligible in light of its advantages. The airfoil chosen is a SSV-2316; a new airfoil custom designed and optimized around the design parameters of the RV-10.
