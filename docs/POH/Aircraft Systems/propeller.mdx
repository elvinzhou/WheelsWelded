title: Propeller

The engine drives two-blade constant speed, non-counterweighted propeller. The propeller is capable of blade angles between a low positive pitch and high positive pitch. This model is not equipped with an air charge and does not feather.

Centrifugal twisting moment acting on the blades moves the blades to a low blade angle to increase RPM. 
Since the centrifugal twisting moment is only present when the propeller is rotating, a mechanical spring is installed 
within the propeller to assist moment of the blades to a lower pitch position as RPM decays, and to reduce the propeller pitch 
to the low pitch stop when the propeller is static. With the blades at low pitch, the load on the starter when starting the engine is reduced significantly. 
Oil pressure opposes the spring and centrifugal twisting moment to move the blades to a high blade angle (high pitch), reducing engine RPM. 
If oil pressure is lost at any time, the propeller will move to low pitch. This occurs because the spring and blade centrifugal twisting moment are no longer opposed by hydraulic oil pressure. 
The propeller will then reduce blade pitch to the low pitch stop.
