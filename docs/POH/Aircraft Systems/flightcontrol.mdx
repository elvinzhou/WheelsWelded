Dual controls are fitted.  
Elevator and ailerons are operated through a system of adjustable push rods. 
The rudder is operated through a cable system to the rudder pedals. 
Pitch trim is by dual tabs on the elevators actuated by an electric servo. 
Roll trim is by a spring system actuated by an electric servo located in the left wing at the most inboard access panel. 
Pitch and roll trim are selected by a set of four switches on the pilotâ€™s stick grip. 
Trim positions are depicted on indicators located on the EFIS. 
Flaps are operated electrically and are controlled by a switch on the panel. 
A flap positioning system selects Reflex, 0, 15 and 30 degrees (need to confirm with measurements) of flap automatically with a temporary press of the flap actuation switch.  
The up position of the switch will fully retract the flaps.
