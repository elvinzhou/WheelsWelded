The batteries are charged via a B&C 460 60 amp belt driven alternator as well as a B&C 410H 40 amp backup alternator. 
The main power bus is provided through a VP-X ECB system. Auxiliary circuits are provided through a fuse panel located on the subpanel behind the pilot's G3X screen. Engine specific circuits are routed through a fuse panel located on the forward face of the subpanel on the left side of the aircraft. 
The E-Bus switch provides power directly from the second battery to the engine specific fuse panel.
