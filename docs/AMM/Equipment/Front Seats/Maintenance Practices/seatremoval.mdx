### Removal of the Front Seats
* A. Remove the seat cushion by unhooking the seat curtains from the velcro at the bottom of the seat frame. 
* B. Use a 3/8" wrench to remove the 4 bolts that fasten the seat adjustment stop. 
* C. Slide the seat back along the seat rails and lift the rear of the seat to clear the reat seat structure. 
NOTE: It may be neccessary to remove the flap torque tube covers to allow the seat to slide back enough to clear the seat rails.
