        * (1) If gray dust residue is found, contact B&C. 
    * B. Check the alternator externally for security of mounting.
        * (1) If oil is leaking around the alternator base, check the torque of the mounting bolts to be 70 in-lbs. 
        * (2) If there is still a leak, replace the gasket. 
        * Note: Do not increase torque above 70 in-lbs.

        * (1) Check for cracks in the webs. Contact B&C for any cracks found.
