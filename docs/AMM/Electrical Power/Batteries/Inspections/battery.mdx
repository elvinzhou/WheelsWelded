* A. Visual Inspection of the Battery
    * (1) Visually inspect the battery for signs of damage - warped or swollen plastic case. 
    * (2) Test the fault indicator
        * a. Touch the fault wire output of the battery to ground
        * b. Check that the internal battery LED and the cockpit fault indicatory illuminates
    * (3) Check that the terminal screws are tight
* B. Do a test of the battery capacity
    * (1) Ensure the battery is fully charged
    * (2) Turn on all electrical loads and start a timer
    * (3) Measure and record the battery's discharge amps using a DC clamp-on current meter at the positive terminal of the battery
    * (4) Using the measured amps in the previous step and the battery's rated capacity, calculate the time to discharge the battery to 80%. 
        * a. Time to discharge 80% (Hours) = $ Rated\; Capacity\; in\; Ah\; * .8 \over Measured\; Discharge\; Amps $
        * b. ETX 900 Rated Capacity = 15.6Ah
    * (5) If the battery shuts off discharge current before the time expires, replace the battery. 
        * a. If the battery has over 50% capacity left, replace the battery within 3 months. 
    * (6) Fully Charge the battery. Repeat the test on the other battery as required.
