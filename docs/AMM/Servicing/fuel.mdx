## 1. General
* A. Fueling
    * (1) Unlock and open the fuel caps by actuating the tabs on the tops of the fuel cap. 
    * (2) Ground the airplane to the fueling mechanism through a ground strap attached at the exhaust.
    * (3) Fuel the airplane. 
    * (4) Note the total fuel taken per tank. 
    * (5) Replace and secure the fuel caps. 
    * (6) Use a GATS jar or equivalent to sump the fuel tanks at each bottom wing skin root. 
    * (7) Remove the ground connection

* B. Defueling
    * (1) Ensure you take precautions around exposed fuel. Wear personal protective equipment. 
    * (2) Bond the fuel receptacle using jumper cables or equivalent ground strap to the aircraft. 
    * (3) Position the receptacle beneath the wing root fuel drains. 
    * (4) Use an 1/2" wrench to unscrew the CAV-110 wing root fuel drains. 
    * (5) Inspect the CAV-110 fuel drains for condition. 
    * (6) Reinstall the fuel drains. Use a dash of fuel lube or equivalent fuel-safe thread sealant on the threads. Take care not to get fuel lube too close to the tip of the drain.
