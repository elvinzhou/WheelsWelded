# Finish Kit Arrival

Last kit! If you don't count FWF that is. The end is in sight. Arrived at just the right time too. With the cabin top almost done, I want to get started on the doors
before proceeding with the cabin top.

I think the schedule should be something like this:
1. Cabin Top rough fit
2. Doors fabricated
3. Doors fit onto cabin top
5. McMaster Carr Door Seal Installation
4. Remove cabin top to fit overhead console
5. Finish cabin top sanding and bolt cabin top to aircraft
6. Transparencies

I'm also planning on final attaching upper forward fuse now since I want to wait until the last minute before ordering avionics.

Need to look into ordering the engine now that, that's the next post.
