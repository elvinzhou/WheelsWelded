# Gear, Brakes,and Wheels
## Gear Install
This was all in all a pretty simple install. I opted for the whole Beringer kit, but really not a lot of changes. Followed manual instructions to install gear legs. The only gotcha here is the shape of the receptacle, there is a "rim" close to the top of the gear tower. If you grease the gear leg like the instructions tell you to you'll hit the ledge and not be able to push it up any further and I spent a lot of time sanding and deburring the bottom opening of the gear tower thinking the powder coating on the inside is the issue. Pack grease not only on the outside of the gear leg, but also on the inside of the gear tower all the way down to where you can feel the tube expanding a bit and the gear leg should then go in with no fuss.

## Beringer Wheels and Brakes
Moving on here this was pretty simple. The only place that needs a bit of thought is the orientation of the brake disc. I specifically asked Beringer support whether there was a specific orientation these needed to go and was told either way is fine. It was not fine. The flat side of the brake disc should face inboard to generate the required clearance. Other than that, install was a breeze. To mount the wheel fairings, you'll need the axle extensions sold by Aircraft Specialty. I also took this time to install jackpoints that mount onto the brake calipers from Flyboy Accessories. Indicate you have Beringer brakes and they will send you longer through bolts that fit Beringer brakes.

## Nose Wheel
Nose wheel Beringer gives you a replacement axle for use with their wheel. Followed all instructions from Vans to install. Make sure the retaining "cup" for the nose gear shock absorbers is mounted the right way or you'll be wondering why you already have a gap in the elastomer pads.
